        I have studied Gender Studies, Cultural Studies and Film and my work experience spans from
        being a videographer and software support for a film software to making films with kids and
        teenagers and being a teacher for Lebenskunde (a subject which teaches elementary school
        kids about ethics and values). <br />
        Currently Iâ€™m deepening my skills in Web Development and in this field I wanna contribute to
        projects aimed at advancing social justice and environmental sustainability. <br />
        I enjoy getting things done!
